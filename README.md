# NYC Tax Lot Selector (BBL List Generator)
This is a simple map-based tool for selecting multiple NYC tax lots and downloading a CSV/SHP file with their BBLs (Borough/Block/Lot).

Built with Department of City Planning's Business Improvement Division, this tool's primary purpose is to complement other information systems that require a list of affected tax lots to describe a study area, rezoning, or other area of interest.  Instead of a more manual process using desktop GIS software, this tool allows the user to quickly identify the lots in their area of interest through a simple, open web interface.  The user can select those lots that are within the area of interest, and quickly download the lot identifiers as machine-readable data.

## Requirements

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM) **version listed in nvmrc**

## Local development

- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-bbl-list-generator.git`
- Navigate to the project directory and start a local webserver
  - **Python 2** `cd labs-bbl-list-generator && python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
  - **Python 3** `cd labs-bbl-list-generator && python -m http.server 8000`
- Open the site in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`

## Architecture

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend mapping tool that interacts with NYC PLUTO data hosted on a Carto server.  The client-side mapping technology is mapbox GL JS.  The Carto server provides vector tiles for NYC's MapPLUTO dataset, and also handles the file downloads based on the user's selection.  

## Deployment

Deploy with dokku:
Create git remote `dokku` if you haven't already `git remote add dokku dokku@{domain}:lotselector`.
Push `master` `git push dokku master`

## MapPLUTO Block Labels
`mappluto_block_centroids` dataset was created to handle labels for the blocks.  This is a bit involved as it's a complex query and carto may timeout, so we had to run the code below by borough, save each result as a new dataset, and `UNION ALL` them together into a new block_centroids dataset.  Query for posterity/maintenance:
```
SELECT ST_Centroid(ST_Union(the_geom)) as the_geom, block, borocode FROM planninglabs.mappluto
WHERE borocode = '1'
GROUP BY block, borocode
```
The above technique ran into issues with invalid geometries in Queens.  We have requested that this block centroids dataset be a routine product of the MapPLUTO workflow, but until then, you may need to use `ST_MakeValid()` when using the above SQL to manually build the centroids table.
